# Coding-Assessment-Practice

## This was created in order to allow aspiring software engineers practice their coding assessment skills in order to prepare for the technical portion of interviews. By working on this project, I have learned how to utilize local storage, addending/removing HTML elements via jQuery, and how to utilize timers.
